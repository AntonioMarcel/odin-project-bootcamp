## Display Properties
Display outer
block, inline, inline-block

display inline-flex: makes elements inside inline

# Flex

## flex-shrink
- flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking.
- flex-shrink only applies when overflow.
- Overflow is when items flex-basis sum higher than container width.

## flex-basis
- Default: auto (use the item’s width/height/content size as the base)
- If set to 0, the item starts with no space and only grows/shrinks based on flex-grow/flex-shrink.
